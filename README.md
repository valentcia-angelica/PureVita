Human Computer Interaction Project

We first created the design in Figma before building the website using HTML to create the structure and content of a web page, CSS to controls the layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual presentation of the web page, and JavaScript to add dynamic functionality to websites. 
This website was created on the Visual Studio Code platform.


Here are the pages on our website:
